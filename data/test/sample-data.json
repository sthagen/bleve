Many details made us feel at home, such as the Ipod dock in the rooms and the Ipads we could use free of charge during breakfast. Most of all, the friendliness of the staff, all of them extremely helpful. I'd highlight Chiara, who gave us many tips, especially telling us to go to Bagdah st., on the Asian side, a place great place that no books mentioned; and Ali, a wonderful guy, much more than a concierge, and a perfect host who did everything he could to make our stay as good as it gets. the proximity to Istklal street, and the tram make the location convenient for both day and night.

It was so peaceful it was easy to forget that we were in the middle of one of the world's busiest cities. The staff were deligthful and couldn't do enough to help. The hotel is in a converted monastary which has been sympathetically refurbished, the artwork depicting istanbul brings a touch of colour - especially in the lift shaft. Our room was enormous and well appointed with a luxurious large bathroom - and yes, a jacuzzi bath. The rooftop restaurant and bar was a perfect way to relax at the end of the day and must have some of the best views in Istanbul over the Bosphorous and the Golden Horn. The food was excellent, modern turkish using french cooking techniques and local produce.

We always prefer smaller boutique places that are well designed and in actual neighborhoods vs. larger impersonal luxury hotels. TomTom didn't dissapoint! As previously mentioned, beautifully designed and furnished rooms, the best toiletries, etc. The roof deck is very nice with a great view. The location is amazing, in-between everywhere that you want to go but far enough away from the touristy madness. I'd argue it's one of the best situated hotels in Istanbul. As mentioned, it's a very steep but quick walk up to the main street of Isklal. However, this can be challenging if you have any mobility issues. In general, the area is rather hilly but so is most of Istanbul. In the other direction, you can walk up into a neighborhood renowned for antiques and nice cafes or down to the tram that takes you to the main tourist attractions or the road to get to Ortokoy or Bebek. At no point does it feel like you are in the \"tourist district\" but you never feel unwelcome or out of place. As for noise, we found the building itself to be quiet and well insulated. You didn't hear noise from the rooms around you and minimal noise from the room above. Nowhere near as bad as what an earlier reviewer described. The only real noise to speak of does come from the kids in the morning and the afternoon who walk on the dead-end road to and from school. Other than this, and some kids playing soccer on occasion, the street outside of the hotel is pretty quiet Breakfast in the morning is great. Freshly baked pastries (done at the hotel) and fruit, cheeses and meats, served by extremely friendly staff. Fuat in particular is a delight to interact with and was extremely helpful. The staff overall is very friendly and accommodating. Everyone at the front desk regardless of time of day did whatever they could to make sure we were receiving the best service possible. There are however a few things that need improvement to make the hotel even better. -While breakfast is excellent, we were less than impressed with dinner. To the point that we ate there once and did not choose to repeat the experience. The service was good but the quality of the food and the cooking was pretty bad esp. considering the prices of the food vs. what can be had in the neighborhood for much less. We are admitted foodies, but we didn't hold the hotel restaurant up to lofty expectations. This needs to be addressed. -While the staff is very friendly and eager to help, the hotel would benefit from a dedicated concierge or someone who really knows about the various restaurants around the city. With a hotel of this caliber, we expected them to be more informed about different places and to let us know how traffic can affect getting there, etc. If you didn't ask them these kinds of questions, it didn't occur to them to tell you. -Lastly, with the windows closed in the room there is zero airflow without having the heat on and it's extremely dry. I understand them not wanting to run the AC unless the temperature warrants, but there should be a way to circulate air without opening the windows in the spring (see my earlier comment about noise from school kids in the morning). In conclusion, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend TomTom to friends and hope to stay there again the next time we are in Istanbul.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Marcelle Haley","date":"2015-07-17 19:17:23 +0300"},{"content":"We had been at Istanbul for business purposes and used to stay at the well-known brands at Taxim.

The bathroom was really modern and had a bath and large separate shower with large overhead shower head, plus hand held shower. All the decor was tasteful and we were at the back of the hotel overlooking the small courtyard garden, so very quiet, although the hotel is on a quiet street anyway. Short walk to the Jardin du Luxembourg and less that 5 mins to a metro, which was on a direct line to the Gare du Nord, so perfect for us as we took the Eurostar from London. Hotel booked us a table at a great restaurant, superb food, which they recommended. Breakfast was served to order and you got croissants, pain au chocolat, bread and could choose omelettes etc. The fruit salad was freshly made, the yoghurts were the posh ones in glass jars.

It turned out amazing. You really don't want to risk a hostel in Paris, they are serious dumps. I did a hostel in Paris in 2007. I picked this hotel due to it's proximity to nightlife in the Latin Quarter and it looked nice. The bathroom had a walk in shower with glass door. Flatscreen TV had an aux speaker in the bathroom to hear the tv while doing your thing. Beds were very comfortable and the room we got was big and facing the street. The street was loud during mid afternoon due to the Catholic school playground down the block. We booked a room with two singles and when we went to check in we were told they had inadvertantly given our room away. I started to freak because I was sure we would get a fast one pulled as usually happens in western europe. We were happy that after my face of death look we were upgraded to a larger room with two double beds. Unfortunately for the poor lady who had booked the room they bumped her and I don't know where she was then moved. Overall the staff was slow on check'in. Breakfast was carbs and coffee. They have a person dedicated only to breakfast and coffee however it seems odd because this is a very small hotel. We were the youngest guests in the hotel by about 50 years. Everyone else looked like they were late fifties to mid seventee's. We are single thirtysomethings. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a peacefull nights sleep in Paris.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Turner Ferry","date":"2013-11-29 14:38:35 +0300"},{"content":"The Villa Madame is a lovely, comfortable, well-located boutique hotel with excellent service. My wife and I enjoyed our stay there immensely. This hotel is chic and luxuriously comfortable especially for the price. Admittedly, the room we had (Classic Double Room) was the smallest hotel room my wife and I had ever seen at about 3m x 3.5m (10' x 12'). The large outdoor terrace, fantastic bathroom (with HermÃ¨s products and great water pressure), deliciously comfortable bed, iPod docking station, super-fast free wi-fi and excellent service more than made up for the tiny room. Alex at the front desk was a delight as she answered our every question and was always happy to chat and share information. The location is excellent being only a few minutes walk from either the Rennes or St-Sulpice Metro stops, 100m from the beautiful Jardin du Luxembourg and within easy walking distance of the myriad of shops and restaurants on both the Rue de Rennes and Boulevard Saint-Germain. The hotel serves a decent continental breakfast which seems expensive at 18â‚¬ but we found a package that was below the normal rate and included breakfast. The breakfast room, as other reviewers have noted, is small and has only four tables for two. All of the tables were occupied each time we went for breakfast but the hotel happily served us as we sat in the little lounge area so it wasn't ever a problem. They don't serve lunch or dinner but there are two brasseries within 50m of the front door and many more restaurants and coffee shops just a few blocks away. There were a few other minor concerns that I had regarding this hotel: - The minibar is stocked only with two bottles of water. It would be nice if there was a limited selection of other beverages and also a kettle for tea/coffee service. - The satellite television has almost 900 channels (yes, I went through them all late one night) but half of them are Arabic and almost all of the rest are in French save for one German language station, a couple of Italian stations and only Bloomberg for the English speakers. Although one doesn't go to Paris to watch TV in the room, it's nice to relax and watch the news or a movie after a long day on the town but unless the above suits you, you won't have much cause to even turn on the set. - The street is very small and it is very difficult to find parking. This is likely not a problem for most visitors but is something to keep in mind especially if you rent a car. Overall, my wife and I loved this hotel. The few cons are heavily outweighed by the comforts we enjoyed. We are very seasoned travelers and despite the tiny room, this hotel experience was one of our best ever. We will definitely stay at the Villa Madame again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Blaze Williamson","date":"2014-04-26 13:59:54 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Madelynn Littel","Marielle Daugherty","Micah Stiedemann","Sandra Howe","Angela Oga"],"vacancy":true,"description":"21 Festival Square.

I have never stayed in Miami before so we did not know what areas were good and what was bad. When we checked in I wasa little concerned as there was a security hut and a guard at the door. We checked in and it was very run down and dirty. They asked for a credit card but I insisted on paying cash as there was no way I was going to hand over my card details. We parked our car and tried to find our room. The halls were all outdoors and very run down. There was a sign saying it had just had a refurb. I could not see where from the outside. It seemed that the area in Miami the motel was in was not a very good one, this concerned us a little. We finally found our room and went in. The room was very basic and smelt of damp. The dead lock on the door was broken and there was no safe in the room. We felt that uncomfortable that at night we pushed our suit cases up to the door. The shower had no presure and was only luke warm and the paint was peeling off from the bathroom. What really appauld us was the floor. I took my shoes and socks off and was walking around in bare foot. After two minutes my partner said \"LOOK AT YOUR FEET\". They were black. The floor was that dirty that in 2 mins my feet were black. I wet a towel and rubbed it along the floor. The towel changed to black and the carpet changed colour. The floor could do with a really good clean. The TV reception was very poor and fuzzy and we gave up in the end. Also the internet/Wifi had little/no signal. It was noisey outside and there were Police sirens sounding all night outside. We found it hard to sleep. We only stayed the night as we had to get up at 4 am to check in for our flight and we checked in at 8pm that evening. Otherwise we would have moved hotel. The only plus side was it was close to the airport. We did not stay for the breakfast but if itn was anything like the room we would have passed anyway.

I have been staying at the Capri since 2001, when my family moved from SF to the North Bay. It used to be a great deal for us ex-pats and while not a luxury hotel, it was clean and comfortable (plus in a great location).My son and I stayed at the Capri this summer and we were terribly let down. They no longer offer specials and while there is renovation occurring, our room was dingy and the bed very uncomfortable. My 9 year old son said, Mom, let's not stay at the Capri anymore. Sadly, I had to agree.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Harry O'Kon I","date":"2014-09-10 11:07:33 +0300"},{"content":"Best Deal in the Marina If you don't mind 1960's decor this place will fit the bill. It's very reasonable and very clean. Sometimes it books up with the Euro tours. Ask to stay on the 3rd floor, with the high ceilings and roof windows. I have actually heard the fog horns at night. There is also plenty of free parking right on-site.This hotel is right off Union street and within walking distance of the Marina Green. Tons of great restaurants and clubs. One of my favorites is the Brazen Head, which is right across the street. A small English Pub with great food and drinks. It's hard to spot but there's a real small sign out front. Also, El Canasta (sp?) has a great steak burrito.","ratings":{"Service":-1.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":-1.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":-1.0,"Rooms":-1.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Sibyl Lind","date":"2014-09-20 18:19:21 +0300"},{"content":"Bed Bugs and Ants The ants didn't bother me. It was the bed bugs I detested.Before staying at the Buena Vista I didn't know what a bed bug looked. But the spots on my arms that looked like flea bites kept appearing after I got home. So I googled them.Yep, sure enough! Up popped a photo of the same type of bug that I had killed after I found it crawling on my husband's pillow while we were staying at the Buena Vista this January 2008!I ordered some all natural bed bug powder to dust all over my house. Even my kids are showing up with the spots.When I called the hotel after I got home to tell them about it they said they would block off that room. But when I called a day or two later there was someone in that room. It doesn't matter if they block off and treat one room. They've got to do the entire premises.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Deshawn Rippin","date":"2014-10-17 15:46:51 +0300"},{"content":"Not a great place to stay This place is falling apart...was once a nice little place to stay but not now.
